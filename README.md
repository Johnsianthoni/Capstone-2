# Capstone-2

OrangeHRM, on the other hand, is an open-source Human Resource Management (HRM) software platform. 
It is used by organizations to manage various HR-related tasks, including employee
information, attendance, leave management, recruitment, performance evaluation, 
and more. OrangeHRM aims to streamline HR processes and improve the overall 
management of human resources within an organization.
To find the specific README file for OrangeHRM or to learn more about its usage and documentation, 
I recommend visiting the official website or the repository where the software is hosted. 
You can also refer to the README or documentation included with the OrangeHRM source code or installation package if you have access to it.

Test case-1:
Creating a "Forgot Password" functionality and sending a password reset link via email in a 
web application like OrangeHRM involves several steps. Here, I'll outline a
high-level approach and provide a simplified Python code example 
using Flask for demonstration purposes. Note that OrangeHRM may use a different technology 
stack, and this example is for educational purposes only.

Test case -2:
Implementing tile validation on an admin page in OrangeHRM typically involves
checking the permissions and roles of the logged-in user to 
determine which tiles or sections they should have access to. 
Below is a simplified Python code example using Flask for demonstration purposes. 
Note that OrangeHRM may use a different technology stack, and this example is for educational purposes only.

In this example, we'll create a basic Flask application with three 
sample tiles: "User Management," "Employee Management," and "Settings." We'll implement tile validation
to control which tiles are visible to users based on their roles.

Test case -3
Implementing Menu bar validation on an admin page in OrangeHRM typically involves
checking the permissions and roles of the logged-in user to 
determine which tiles or sections they should have access to. 
Below is a simplified Python code example using Flask for demonstration purposes. 
Note that OrangeHRM may use a different technology stack, and this example is for educational purposes only.

In this example, we'll create a basic Flask application with three 
sample Menubar: "Admin," "Employee Management," and "Settings." We'll implement Menu bar validation
to control which tiles are visible to users based on their roles.
